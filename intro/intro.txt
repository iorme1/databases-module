2.) Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

Answer:
    A text file can be used if you are not running multiple instances of a program at the same time.
    If you run multiple instances of a program and both instances save data to the same text file
    at the same time, then you run into problems. The first potential outcome is that one will fail
    to update the file and the other will succeed. The other potential outcome is that the second
    attempt to change the file will overwrite the previous attempt. A database can deal with multiple
    applications accessing/updating files concurrently. Databases also give you the benefit of easily
    searching for specific data.
